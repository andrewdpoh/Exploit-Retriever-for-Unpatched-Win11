# Exploit Retriever for Unpatched Win11
## Description
This tool can retrieve exploits for unpatched versions of Windows 11 machines from Exploit-DB and Github based on the Windows version.  

I originally based this project around the WES-NG tool. However, I found that it was quite limited in ability (using missingkbs.exe requires admin privilege, which defeats the purpose of scanning if the goal is privilege escalation | using systeminfo would provide very few CVEs as it does not take into account the Windows update version).  

Hence, I created exploit_retriever.py and tried my own method of enumeration (see exploit_retriever.py step 1) which was specific to the version of the target Windows machine. This allowed for more CVE results for outdated versions of Windows.  


## Usage
### exploit_retriever.py
1. In the target machine's command prompt, run the following:  
    a. `ver > sysinfo.txt & echo %PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE% >> sysinfo.txt`
4. Move the resultant sysinfo.txt file into the same directory as exploit_retriever.py (or just copy and paste the text)
5. Run `py exploit_retriever.py`


### update_exploitDB.py:
1. `py update_exploitDB.py`  
This is to update the exploitDB.csv sheet
